Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

Introduction:


This repository presents a sales data analysis project for Bright Coffee Shop, aimed at delivering valuable business insights to support the strategic decisions of a newly appointed CEO. The project uses historical transactional data to understand sales patterns, identify high-performing products, and highlight opportunities for revenue growth. As a Data Analyst, I utilized SQL, Excel, and MIRO, CANVA to extract, process, analyze, and present key insights from the data.

Problem Statement:


Bright Coffee Shop has experienced fluctuations in product sales and customer activity throughout the day. With a new CEO onboard, there is a pressing need to identify which products drive revenue, understand customer purchasing patterns, and uncover underperforming areas. However, the data had not been previously analyzed in-depth, and the business lacked actionable insights to support data-driven decisions.

Objectives:


• Analyze historical transactional data to identify revenue drivers and weak products.

• Determine peak time slots based on customer purchasing behavior.

• Uncover sales trends across products and time intervals.

• Present data-driven recommendations for marketing, stock, and operational strategies.

Aims:


• Equip the new CEO with a comprehensive understanding of Bright Coffee Shop’s sales performance.

• Support strategic decisions that can lead to increased profitability and operational efficiency.

• Lay the foundation for future analytics and automation within the business.

Tools Used:


• Data Processing & Storage:
 
     o Snowflake – for loading, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing transactional data
 
     o SQL – for aggregations, time-based grouping, and metric calculations

• Data Analysis & Visualization:

     o Microsoft Excel – for dashboards, pivot tables, and graphs

• Planning & Documentation:

     o Miro – for Data Flow & Architecture Diagram

• Presentation: 

     o CANVA - for executive presentation

Recommendations:


Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:

•	Run marketing campaigns during slow periods (e.g., “Afternoon Perks” or “Evening Chill Deals”) to lift non-peak traffic.

•	Stock and feature bestsellers prominently, especially for morning demand: Espresso, Chai Tea, and Green Beans.

•	Promote underperforming products creatively, or reevaluate them altogether, especially items with consistently low sales.
