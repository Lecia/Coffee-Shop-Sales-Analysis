Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

**Introduction:**


This repository presents a sales data analysis project for Bright Coffee Shop, aimed at delivering valuable business insights to support the strategic decisions of a newly appointed CEO. The project uses historical transactional data to understand sales patterns, identify high-performing products, and highlight opportunities for revenue growth. As a Data Analyst, I utilized SQL, Excel, and MIRO, CANVA to extract, process, analyze, and present key insights from the data.

**Problem Statement:**


Bright Coffee Shop has experienced fluctuations in product sales and customer activity throughout the day. With a new CEO onboard, there is a pressing need to identify which products drive revenue, understand customer purchasing patterns, and uncover underperforming areas. However, the data had not been previously analyzed in-depth, and the business lacked actionable insights to support data-driven decisions.

**Objectives:**


• Analyze historical transactional data to identify revenue drivers and weak products.

• Determine peak time slots based on customer purchasing behavior.

• Uncover sales trends across products and time intervals.

• Present data-driven recommendations for marketing, stock, and operational strategies.

**Aims:**


• Equip the new CEO with a comprehensive understanding of Bright Coffee Shop’s sales performance.

• Support strategic decisions that can lead to increased profitability and operational efficiency.

• Lay the foundation for future analytics and automation within the business.

**Tools Used:**


• Data Processing & Storage:
 
     o Snowflake – for loading, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing transactional data
 
     o SQL – for aggregations, time-based grouping, and metric calculations

• Data Analysis & Visualization:

     o Microsoft Excel – for dashboards, pivot tables, and graphs

• Planning & Documentation:

     o Miro – for Data Flow & Architecture Diagram

• Presentation: 

     o CANVA - for executive presentation

**Recommendations:**


Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:

Focus on best-sellers like Brewed Chai Tea and Gourmet Brewed Coffee by promoting them more and bundling with snacks to increase spending. Leverage the busy morning period with exclusive deals and ensure staffing and stock are optimized. To improve low evening sales, introduce "Happy Hour" offers or create a more relaxed, inviting atmosphere.
Bakery items generate strong revenue and can be used to complement popular drinks. Customize product promotions per store based on their strengths — for example, focus on Coffee in Hell’s Kitchen and Tea in Astoria. Lastly, consider phasing out low-performing products like Packaged Chocolate and Loose Tea to focus on what sells best.
